### Reimagining Parachain Auctions with an Ethereum Vault Strategy


Amidst all of the hype in the DeFi space over parachains, Composable Finance is introducing a new solution which allows for participation in our parachain with ETH or any ERC-20 token asset, rather than purchasing DOT/KSM and leaving it to sit. With our novel approach, we expand our ability to stake DOT/KSM and allow for users to continue to gain profits on their staked assets.

Parachain vault strategies [details](https://composablefi.medium.com/reimagining-parachain-auctions-with-an-ethereum-vault-strategy-a0dcc3481759).


Users participating through our strategies get:
- Exposure to Composable Tokens
- Exposure to Polkadot parachain auction
- Exposure to DOT/KSM
- Yield on staking
- Minting our cross-layer stablecoin, Equal Cash off the receipt token from the vault


In addition to its direct benefits to users, this strategy fits into our overall mission as a platform; one of our main goals is connecting the spaces of Ethereum and Polkadot, and that begins even at the parachain auction level.
